 Stand-alone Controller


Angular 1.3 or higher the stand-alone function approach shown above won't work since the Angular team changed that functionality
//this $scope AngularJS passess and helps in glueing the View and Controller



function MyController($scope) {

    $scope.intro = "Getting started with Controllers";

    #scope.btn1Clicked = function() {
        alert("Button 1 click handled in controller");
    }
}
